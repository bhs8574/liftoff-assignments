# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
At some point in LC101 while trying to brainstorm ideas for my future LiftOff project, Instructor Shawn suggested trying 
to automate or aid in something that I or someone I know has to do regularly. At that point I immediately thought about
how my partner complains every week about having to track and release her time spent working on specific projects and 
clients for her job. She has an application on her device for tracking her time already, but it's unwieldy and not very
user-friendly.

My project will be a time keeper app that allows users to sign in and keep track of the time they've worked on specific 
clients, projects, and other activities throughout the week. Users will be able to create activity categories such as 
Client, Networking, Continued Education, and Training and make specific entries under each category. For instance, the 
user can create a "Lunches" entry under "Networking" to track how many hours are spent on networking lunches through the
week.  Users will be able to enter time in different ways.  Through a Timer feature, where the user clicks start when they
start an activity, and end when they finish an activity.  There will be a manual time entry, where you enter an amount of 
hours to add to an entry. Finally there will be a batch entry feature, if the user needs to add hours to multiple entries
at once.  There will be an option to show a summary screen, export the data to a specific format, and to clear the time kept
to start a new week.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have  their own categories, 
entries, and data.

Stop Watch Feature: Users will be able to use a start/stop button to use a timer to track time spent actively working on an entry
and that time will automatically be added to the time for that activity.

Individual and batch time entry: Users will be able to manually add hours to a certain entry/activity or add hours to many
activities at once from a time entry option.  

Sort/filter feature: Users will be able to sort or filter activities by category, time, name, and perhaps other criteria.


### Technologies
Java

Spring Boot

MySQL

Hibernate

Thymeleaf templates

JavaScript/CSS/HTML

### What I'll Have to Learn
I feel like I'll need to learn some more JavaScript or dive deeper into Thymeleaf/Spring to figure out how to implement
the batch time entry they way I want to.  I'm not sure how to update potentially every entry in a table with a single form.

I also will need to learn a lot more about user accounts.  I don't currently know how to tie different data in a database
to different users.

In order to make my project look nice, I'll need to learn a lot more CSS and maybe some more JavaScript as well.
